Here is the complete **README.md** content for your **Northwind Traders SQL Project**, ready for you to copy and paste into your GitHub project file:

## 💾 Northwind Traders Database Analysis (SQL)

**A comprehensive SQL project using the classic Northwind sample database to query, aggregate, and analyze core business data, including sales, inventory, and employee performance.**

-----

## 💡 Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to leverage standard and advanced SQL techniques to extract meaningful business intelligence from the Northwind database. The queries focus on answering key questions, such as:

1.  What is the **total sales revenue** generated by each product?
2.  Which employees have processed the **most orders**?
3.  Which customers have placed orders, and which ones **have not** (using different types of joins)?
4.  What are the total quantities sold for each product category?

## 🛠️ Key SQL Skills Demonstrated

The attached `Northwind.sql` file demonstrates proficiency across fundamental and intermediate SQL concepts:

### Data Retrieval and Manipulation

  * **Various JOIN Types:** Demonstrated the ability to correctly apply **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, **RIGHT JOIN**, and **CROSS JOIN** to combine data across multiple related tables (`Customers`, `Orders`, `Employees`, `Products`, etc.).
  * **Filtering (WHERE):** Applied conditions to filter results, including identifying records with missing associations (e.g., customers without orders).
  * **Sorting (ORDER BY):** Organized query results based on relevant columns, such as ordering total sales in descending order.

### Aggregation and Business Intelligence

  * **Aggregate Functions:** Used **`SUM()`** (to calculate total revenue/sales) and **`COUNT()`** (to count customers per country or orders per employee) to summarize large datasets.
  * **Grouping (GROUP BY):** Grouped results by dimensions like `Country`, `ShipperName`, and `CategoryName` to provide segmented metrics.
  * **Calculated Fields:** Defined and calculated new metrics, such as `TotalSales` (Quantity \* Price).

### Query Optimization and Readability

  * **Aliasing:** Employed **Table and Column Aliases** (e.g., `FROM Customers as c`) to improve query readability and efficiency.
  * **String Manipulation:** Used **`CONCAT_WS()`** to combine fields (e.g., employee first name and last name) for better presentation.

## 💻 Code Snippets & Examples

The following snippet demonstrates calculating the total revenue generated by each product, showcasing `JOIN`, `SUM()`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`:

```sql
SELECT
    p.ProductName,
    SUM(od.Quantity * p.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM
    Order_Details AS od
JOIN
    Products AS p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY
    p.ProductName
ORDER BY
    TotalSales DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT
concat_ws(", ", e.firstname, e.lastname) as employee, count(orderid) AS employeesales
FROM
  orders as o 
JOIN
  employees as e on e.employeeid = o.employeeid
GROUP BY
  o.employeeid
ORDER BY
  employeesales desc;
